> Independent Study at the South Carolina Governorâ€™s School for Science and Mathematics is designed to provide additional
opportunities for highly motivated students to pursue areas of their special interest. Independent Study courses are student-initiated and allow students to explore areas of interest beyond what is offered in the catalog. These courses are aimed at enhancing the quality of our academic program by allowing students to develop customized courses in areas of instructor expertise beyond the current course catalog. Independent Study courses are student-initiated and are considered to be a course contract between the student and faculty member to complete the course of study.
