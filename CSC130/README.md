> A second course in computer science in which students are introduced to algorithm design and analysis, big-Oh
notation, and algorithm classification by efficiency and correctness. The course covers basic algorithm design,
strategies, mathematical analysis, and approaches to problem solving. Topics include algorithms for searching and
sorting, graph theory and graph algorithms, and other computational problems. This course is designed for
students who already know a programming language and would like to continue taking advanced electives in
computer science. <I>PREREQ: CSC101 and CSC102, or CSC 110, or as a COREQ: CSC102, or permission of
