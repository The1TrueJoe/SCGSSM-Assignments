> This course focuses on the basic algorithms of Artificial Intelligence. Problem modeling methods include data
classification, regression analysis, clustering, and time series analysis. Supervised and unsupervised training as
well as stochastic and deterministic training will be employed in projects. Teach paper cups to win a simple game
based on Nim. Learn several methods for normalization of data and error calculation. Different methods of training
are applied to classic problems such as the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem. <I>PREREQ:
