> Students will examine the differences between machine code, assembly language, interpreters, and compilers. The students will have hands-on experience of writing the code to simulate machine code and designing and implementing a compiler for a SIMPLE language based on that machine code. Building this compiler includes the following steps: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, data type checking and building a symbol table, machine codegeneration. Students in this course will work in teams to develop a timeline and code for their design and testing of the system. Students will learn how to program using other computer languages such as C++, PC Scheme, and Python in order to compare these languages with each other and with our SIMPLE language. <I>PREREQ: CSC130 or permission of instructor. This course will meet 4 times a week</I>
