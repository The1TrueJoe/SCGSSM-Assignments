> This course is a survey of the underpinnings of computer networks. It will cover the basics of network architecture,
topology, protocols, and telecommunications. Students will learn how a request on a web browser is packaged and
transferred over the Internet to a destination address and how the results of the request are processed and
delivered back again. By the end of the course students will have demonstrated a competence in IP addressing,
packet tracing, OSI and TCP/IP models, and configuring routers and switches to use networking protocols. The
course is a mixture of discussion and hands-on activities.
