> This course is a survey of the underpinnings of computer networks. It will cover the basics of network architecture,
topology, protocols, and telecommunications. Students will learn how a request on a web browser is packaged and
transferred over the Internet to a destination address and how the results of the request are processed and
delivered back again. By the end of the course students will have demonstrated a competence in IP addressing,
packet tracing, OSI and TCP/IP models, and configuring routers and switches to use networking protocols. The
course is a mixture of discussion and hands-on activities.

>Begin preparing for a networking career with this introduction to how networks operate. This first course in the 3-course CCNA series introduces architectures, models, protocols, and networking elements – functions needed to support the operations and priorities of Fortune 500 companies to small innovative retailers. You’ll even get the chance to build simple local area networks (LANs). Developing a working knowledge of IP addressing schemes, foundational network security, you'll be able to perform basic configurations for routers and switches. No prerequisites required. After completing all three CCNA courses, you are ready to take the CCNA Certification. 
<br><br>
Core Skills:
<br>
> 1. Build simple LANs, perform basic configurations for routers and switches, and implement IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.
> 2. Configure routers, switches, and end devices to provide access to local and remote network resources and to enable end-to-end connectivity between remote devices.
> 3. Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills using real equipment and Cisco Packet Tracer.
> 4. Configure and troubleshoot connectivity a small network using security best practices.
