> Interim is a two-week term between the Fall and Spring terms where Govies take a single class that explores a topic of interest with depth and fun. Once again, there is a wide variety of courses for students to choose from, and several trips to Europe and South America are planned.

> The GSSM Makerspace gives students the opportunity to pursue their technological interests in 3d design and physical computing in a relaxed environment.  No previous experience is required, and students can learn the basics, or they can come into the class with the intention of developing advanced ideas. Students will create their designs using the Arduino microprocessor and associated sensors, motors, etc., as well as 3d printed models using graphic design tools like SolidWorks, OnShape, or TinkerCad. Students who are on the robotics team can work on the robot design and functionality. We will probably take trips to Integrated Systems, Inc, and Sonoco.
